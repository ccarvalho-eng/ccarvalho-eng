## Hi, I am Cristiano (/-_・)/D・・・・・------ →


1. **Workstation**
    1. I like to code from anywhere. No need for a fancy office. Preferably from cozy and quite places. 
2. **Meetings**
    1. They should end with actionable items and takeaways. 
3. **Problem solving**
    1. I think solutions should be simple even for complex problems. 
4. **Architecture**
    1. If we can't explain, we don't understand the problem neither the solution.
5. **Customer success**
    1. I believe we must empathize with customers and give them the best we have.
6. **Code Reviews**
    1. We should take them to the heart and use them as a learning opportunity. 
7. **Refactoring**
    1. Don’t change something that is working. We can always keep it backward compatible while adding a better version.
