## Hi, I am Cristiano (/-_・)/D・・・・・------ →

Hey there! I'm a Senior Software Engineer who's been in the game for over 5 years. I love building web apps that are fast, solid, and reliable using TDD and functional programming.

I believe that archery and coding have a lot in common! Both demand precision, practice, and a desire to improve your skills. Whether you're hitting a bullseye or launching an impressive feature, the satisfaction of success is hard to beat.

In fact, archery and coding can even complement each other. Archery can help clear your mind and improve focus, which can translate into better coding skills. And coding can help you think logically and methodically, which can benefit your aim and technique in archery. Who knows, maybe practicing archery will help you solve that tricky coding problem you've been struggling with! At the end of the day, both activities require patience, dedication, and a willingness to push yourself to be the best you can be.
