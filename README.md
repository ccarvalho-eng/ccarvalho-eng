## Hi, I am Cristiano (/-_・)/D・・・・・------ →

I am Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in web development. I enjoy using TDD to build solid, and maintainable applications. I like thinking functional, apply simple solutions to complex problems, and put that last piece of the puzzle exactly where it should be.
